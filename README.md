# NSGA-II Optimization Algorithm for Maximizing PDR and Minimizing Redundancy

### Overview
This repository implements NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) to maximize Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and minimize Packet Redundancy in mobile networks with fixed source and destination.

### Motivation & Methodology
We explore NSGA-II's effectiveness for optimizing PDR and redundancy in mobile networks. While robust, it's vital to consider practical challenges beyond mathematical correctness, such as node failure. NSGA-II optimizes network efficiency by leveraging node connectivity but overlooks factors like node failure, network traffic, and topology changes.

### Results & Future Work
Experimental results assess NSGA-II's effectiveness in optimizing PDR and redundancy. While promising, future work involves refining fitness functions, exploring alternative algorithms, and incorporating factors like node failure, network traffic, and topology changes for comprehensive optimization.
